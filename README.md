# BME 580 - Final Project
Authors: Sarah Piper, Nikhita Gopisetty, Michael Larbie


# Purpose
There is limited analysis on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted immigrant communities.
However, states and counties with high densities of immigrants tend to have high numbers of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.
Our project will explore the differences in positive COVID-19 diagnoses in immigrant versus non-immigrant populations in the 
Northeast, Midwest, South, and West regions of the US. We will study adults’ demographic information, healthcare utilization, food security,
and comorbidities to determine how a person’s susceptibility to these different factors impacted susceptibility to COVID-19 infection.


# Data
This data was collected from the 2021 National Health Interview Survery (NHIS).
The dataset was combrised of 29,582 observations and 622 variables.
